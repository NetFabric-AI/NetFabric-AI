title: About Us

Our team, comprising ETH Zurich researchers and serial entrepreneurs, finds current network monitoring solutions inadequate due to their complexity, scalability limitations, and inefficiency in providing real-time insights. Inspired by these deficiencies, we aim to develop an intuitive, scalable, and real-time monitoring solution to address these challenges effectively.
