title: About Us
---

Our team, comprising ETH Zurich researchers and serial entrepreneurs, finds
current network monitoring solutions inadequate due to their superficial
understanding of network data and narrow focus on few data sources. Inspired by
these deficiencies, we aim to develop an intuitive, scalable, and real-time
monitoring solution to answer any question about any computer network.
